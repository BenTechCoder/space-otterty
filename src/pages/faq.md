### So did you make this?

Well...yes! This template is a fork of [eleventy-parcel](https://github.com/mbarker84/eleventy-parcel) by [Michelle Barker](https://css-irl.info/) so most of the scafolding was done for me by the time I came around. I rewrote the css and tweaked the Nunjucks setup. Also the following features were directly taken from [Stephanie Eckle's 11ty Netlify Jumpstart](https://11ty-netlify-jumpstart.netlify.app/) to whom I give full credit:

* RSS feed
* Sitemap.xml
* Automatic Opengraph social images generation

### Why did you make this?

Mostly for convinience since I found myself struggling to set up new projects from scratch.

### What's with the name?

The name is somwhat inspired by the song [Space Oddity](https://open.spotify.com/track/6kEyuKmF4kZylB5LcuRd8Y?adlt=strict&toWww=1&redig=B4AC48BC14C04310AAF5FBB4FAA39E2D) and after thinking up the Sea Otter mascot the branding for this starter was born.
